# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
In this project we created a deep q-learning algorithm to solve a maze. The code that was given was TreasureMaze.py and GameExperience.py. As well as the outline of the TreasureMaze Game. The code that I wrote was the Deep Q-learning algorithm. 

# Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
## What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer Scientist are scientist in nature as any other scientist. We find a problem and propose a hypothesis and we test it. We simply use computers to help us in this approach. This can range from simply populating a database to creating a large language model.

## How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I approach problems with the scientific method. I first ask a question, then I research the topic, then I form a hypothesis, next I test with a series of experiments, then I analyze the data of these experiments, then I form a conclusion. 

## What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical responsibilities lie with an organization to not sell out their propietary information. The ethical responsibility to the end-user is to not exploit them and invade their personal information.
